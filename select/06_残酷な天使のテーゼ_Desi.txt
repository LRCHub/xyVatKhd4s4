Like an angel with cruel and merciless intent
Go forth, young boy, and you'll become a legend

In time, this blue of the sky
Will reach out to knock on the door to your heart
You're looking at me
Make it all that you see

Content and we're merely smiling

Once more, the touch you long for
Consumes you in yearning to find that embrace
You're unaware though
Now to what fate will sow
Temptation implores you to know

Someday you'll notice – I pray that you'll realize
These wings on your back aren't a dream
At last, you'll have all you need to escape to
The world where you'll finally be free

This was all a Cruel Angel's Thesis from the start
Brought to life, out window now it's taking flight
Scorching pathos if you betray your memory
