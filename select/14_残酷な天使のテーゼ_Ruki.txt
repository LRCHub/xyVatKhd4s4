Like an angel with cruel and merciless intent,
Go forth young boy and you'll become a legend

In time, this blue of the sky
Will reach out to knock on the door of your heart
You're looking at me
Make it all that you see

Content and we're merely smiling

Once more, the touch you long for
Cosumes you in yearning to find that embrace
You're unaware though
Now to what fate will sow
Temptation implores you to know

Some day you'll notice, i pray that you realise
These wings on your back aren't a dream
At least, you'll have all you need to escape to
The world where you'll finally be free

This was all a Cruel Angel's Thesis from the start
Brought to life, out window now its taking floght
Scorching parhos if you betray your memory
Folow this deviant-divine philosophy

Showing more than these stars that bathe the galaxy
Go forth, young boy, and you'll become a legend

With grace, and in my embrace
You'll fall deep into sleep, so tempted to stay
In the morning that falls
You alone will be called
By message from the realm of your dreans

Moonlight reflects in your sight
The night that surrounds you invites radiance
And it's all in goodwill
But if time could stand still
This momentz i'd freeze it in place

If there is meaning in two people meeting
Then maybe we're doing this right
Within this trial, that might be the bible -
The way that we'll both reach the light

This was all a Cruel Angel's Thesus from the start
In its time, for the sorrow in us to arise
You held tightly to all there's left and tangible
Struck between both the dream world snd the actual
You out-shine any mortal who has walked the earth
Go forth young boy and you'll become a legend

People who weave love, create without knowing
And carve a path through history
Though i'll take a steand
I'm still only human
The goodness you need can (not) be me

This was all a Cruel Angel's Thesis from the start
Brought to lifez out window now it's flight
Scorching pathos if you betray your memory
Follow this deviant-divine philosophy

Shining more than these stars that bathe the galaxy
Go forth, young boy, and you'll become a legend
